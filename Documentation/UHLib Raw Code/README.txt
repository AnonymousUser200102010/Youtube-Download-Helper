In the interest of saving time, and preventing carpal tunnel, the project will only include the UniversalHandlersLibrary source code; no update notes or anything of the sort. The only other documents will be this one and the UHLib license, which I reserve the right to change at any time.

This allows you to not only check over all changes to the library but modify and improve it as well, if you so choose!
