In the interest of saving time, and preventing carpal tunnel, this folder will only include the source code; no update notes or anything of the sort. The only other documents will be this one and the license, which I reserve the right to change at any time.

All pertinent updates will be fused with the main program's updates and stored in it's update notes.

This allows you to not only check over all changes to the library but modify and improve it as well, if you so choose!
